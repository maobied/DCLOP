DCLOP Version 1


This code is an implementation of the paper "Deep Clustering-based Anomaly Detection and Health Monitoring for Satellite Telemetry"
The Telemetry data used here is skCube satellite telemetry data (numerical) in csv format. This telemetry data is not public till now.
The DCLOP code is applicable on high-dimensional satellite numerical telemetry data.
The CLOP code is an adaptation of PyNomaly project by Valentino Constantinou https://github.com/vc1492a
